          <p>
            A keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer.
            Similar to an electric typewriter, a keyboard is composed of buttons
            used to create letters, numbers, and symbols, and perform additional
            functions. The following sections provide more in-depth information
            and answers to some of the frequently asked questions about the
            keyboard.

          <h2>mouse</h2>
          <p>
            A computer mouse (plural mice, sometimes mouses)[nb 1] is a
            hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion
            relative to a surface. This motion is typically translated into the
            motion of a pointer on a display, which allows a smooth control of
            the graphical user interface of a computer.

          <h2>monitor</h2>
          <p>
            A computer monitor is an output device that displays information in
            pictorial or text form. A monitor usually comprises a visual
            display, some circuitry, a casing, and a power supply. The display
            device in modern monitors is typically a thin film transistor liquid
            crystal display (TFT-LCD) with LED backlighting having replaced
            cold-cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL) backlighting.

          <p>
            A joystick is an input device consisting of a stick that pivots on a
            base and reports its angle or direction to the device it is
            controlling. A joystick, also known as the control column, is the
            principal control device in the cockpit of many civilian

          <p>
            In computing, a printer is a peripheral machine which makes a
            persistent representation of graphics or text, usually on paper.[1]
            While most output is human-readable, bar code printers are an
            example of an expanded use for printers.

          <h2>scaner</h2>
          <p>
            An image scanner—often abbreviated to just scanner—is a device that
            optically scans images, printed text, handwriting or an object and
            converts it to a digital image. Commonly used in offices are
            variations of the desktop flatbed scanner where the document is
            placed on a glass window for scanning.
